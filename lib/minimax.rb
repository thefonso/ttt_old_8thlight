   # Final Game States are ranked according to whether they’re a win, draw, or loss.
   #
   # Intermediate Game States are ranked according to whose turn it is and the available moves.
   # If it’s X’s turn, set the rank to that of the maximum move available. In other words, if a move will result in a win, X should take it.
   # If it’s O’s turn, set the rank to that of the minimum move available. In other words, If a move will result in a loss, X should avoid it.
